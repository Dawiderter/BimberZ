# ðŸš¨ (WIP) THIS PROJECT IS VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸš¨

# BimberZ Game Framework
A small framework for making games with main purpose being making quick game jam games and having fun.
Built with the power of Rust and wgpu-rs.
This project is in part inspired by the concept of "fantasy consoles" like PICO-8.

## Goals
- Make creating games quick and fun.
- Make it so the user can think more about "what" they want to do, no about "how" to do it.
- Offer full battery-included experience for common things.
- At least that's the plan so far.

## Non-goals
- Be super performant. This framework is mainly intended for small-in-scope games.
- Be fully customizable. I want to prioritize ease of use and quality of builtin tools, although some kind of plugin system might come later.

## Planned features
- Dedicated scripted language tightly integrated with the rest of the framework.
- Embedding the game in the web browser using wasm.
- Experimental custom raymarching renderer.
- Various builtin tools, like scene editor.
